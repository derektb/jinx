      //      - When something start to happens to an art asset
      //      - When something is finished happening to an art asset
      //      - Making sure separate simultaneous things aren't happening to an art asset
      //      - What snabbt things are happening to an art asset.
      //  (everything else is probably not important)
      //  But then again, getAssetAnimations is the gatekeeper for all animations, so in theory, it has to be flexible, too.  Smart.  Delegating a lot.
