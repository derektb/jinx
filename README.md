# Jinx

Jinx is a Twine 2 story format for building and running interactive comics in Twine.  It uses sequentially-displayed panels and animated, layer-based, multi-stage panel art to create a more measured, time-based, and delightful reading experience.

It is originally based off the Snowman story format created by Chris Klimas, and is developed maintained by me, Derek Timm-Brock.  Comics I've made with Jinx can be viewed at [wizard.town](http://wizard.town).

## Building From Source

Run `npm install` to install dependencies. `grunt` or `grunt build` will create a testing version of the format at `index.html`, and `grunt package` will build a release version ready to be used in Twine under `dist/`.
